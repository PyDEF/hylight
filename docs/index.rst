The Hylight Package
===================

About
-----

Welcome to Hylight's documentation!

Hylight is a post-processing tool written in Python to simulate the
luminescence of solids based on the results of *ab initio* computations.

You may be interested in reading our first paper using it on the luminescence of |BaZrO3:Ti| [BaZrO3:Ti]_.

To learn how to use Hylight, you can read the tutorial_.
Finally there is a complete reference_ that goes over all individual functions implemented in the package.
