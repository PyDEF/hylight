# The Hylight Package

## About

Welcome to Hylight's code repository!

Hylight is a post-processing tool written in Python to simulate the
luminescence of solids based on the results of *ab initio* computations.

You may be interested in reading our first paper using it:
[Modeling Luminescence Spectrum of BaZrO3:Ti Including Vibronic Coupling from First Principles Calculations][1].

To learn how to use Hylight, you can read [documentation](https://hylight.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Citing Hylight

If you ever use Hylight for a published scientific work, we would ask you to cite the related paper:
